Quickstart
==========

This section of the documentation gives a brief overview of how to get started using
cblaster and a broad overview of its features.

Search modes
------------
cblaster has two search modes, which you can specify using the ``--mode`` argument.
By default (i.e. ``--mode`` not provided), it will be set to remote, and a fully
remote cblaster search will begin.
Alternatively, local mode performs a search against a local DIAMOND database, which
is much quicker (albeit requiring some initial setup).
